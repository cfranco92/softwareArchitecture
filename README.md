# Stages of the software development process
The traditional development process has very marked stages, which have inputs, processes and outputs that function as inputs to the next stage.

* **Analysis of requirements:** Everything is born from a trigger that creates the need to create an artifact or a system. We need to understand what the problem is that we want to solve. There are business requirements, functional requirements, non-functional requirements.

* **Solution design:** Deep analysis of problems to work together and propose possible solutions. The result of this should be the detail of the solution, through requirements, modeling, etc.

* **Development and evolution:** Implementation of the solution, to guarantee that what is being built is what is expected. At the end of this stage we will have a software artifact.

* **Deployment:** Here we will need infrastructure and operational roles to be able to make the device available.

* **Maintenance and evolution:** Development + deployment + maintenance, at this stage we are attentive to possible improvements made to the system. At this stage the software is maintained until the software is no longer needed.
